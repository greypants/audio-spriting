HTML 5 Audio Spriting
=====================
An attempt to get working cross browser audio spriting with iOS support, based in part on remysharp.com/2010/12/23/audio-sprites/

###Notes:
* For consistent playback, keep your minimum clip length to 0.5 seconds
* Looping SUCKS. Use only on longer clips, where your're ok with a slight hiccup.
